# Active Bugs In game:

1) Sword does multiple instances of damage in a single swing
2) If you turn on V-Sync in main menu settings, and go in game, then the settings in pause menu will show V-Sync as disabled, but it is actually enabled.
3) Player can move even during the opening Timeline (Easy fix)
4) Sword deals damage even when it is not swinging
5) Can get stuck in some places on map (Mainly near mountains). (Easy fix)
6) Not really a bug, but, The prompt talking about interacting with objects/NPC's should be explained or shown more properly (easy fix)
